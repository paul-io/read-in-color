# Privacy Policy for Read In Color

**Effective Date:** September 11, 2025

## Overview
Read In Color is a Chrome extension that allows users to customize text and background colors on websites to improve their reading experience. This privacy policy explains how we handle user data.

## Information We Collect

### With Google Sign-In (Optional)
- **Email address**: Collected only when you voluntarily sign in with Google to save custom color themes
- **Google account identifier**: Used to associate your saved themes with your account
- **Extension settings and preferences**: Stored using Chrome’s chrome.storage.sync, which syncs through your Google Account across devices

### Without Sign-In
- **Preset Themes**: Guests can apply built-in preset themes. No personal data or saved theme data is stored.

## How We Use Your Information

- **Email addresses**: Used solely to identify your account and associate saved custom themes
- **Theme data**: Used to provide theme customization functionality and persist your preferences
- **No tracking**: We do not track your browsing habits, visited websites, or reading activity

## Data Storage and Security

- **Chrome sync storage**: Theme preferences and settings are stored using Chrome's sync storage system, which syncs data across all your devices where you're signed into Chrome through Google's servers
- **No third-party sharing**: We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.

## Your Rights and Choices

- **Sign-in required for custom themes**: Creating custom themes requires Google sign-in, but all preset themes work without an account
